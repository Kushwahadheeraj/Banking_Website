                                <br><br>What makes our Internet Banking Services safe and secure?<br>
    
                                Security is our top priority. We have equipped our Internet Banking Services with industry
                                standard security technology and practices to ensure that our customers are fully protected
                                against third party fraud. <br>
    
                                <br>You are uniquely identified by your User ID and password every time you login bank
                                online.
                                <br>Your financial information is protected by 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption
                                , the most secure form of commercially available technology.
                                <br>If you forget to log off after logging in our Internet Banking Services, we activate an
                                automatic 'time-out' after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.
                                <br>The pages you have viewed during your banking session expire to prevent the pages from
                                being stored in your browser, ensuring that no one can access these pages and your financial
                                information.
    
                                <br>We also track the number of logon attempts. When we find five consecutive incorrect
                                login user-id/passwords have been attempted, we will immediately disable Internet Banking
                                Services and customers will need to contact us again to get the services enabled.

                                <li>Use a combination of numbers, upper and lower case letters with at least one special

                                <li>Avoid using the same details that you use to access other online services such as email

                                <li>You should be the only one who knows your password(s). Never give it to anyone. No one
                                    at PNB will ever ask you to tell them your Internet banking password, ensuring it
                                    remains private and confidential to you. Avoid everybody using your computer and limit

                                <li>Enter your user-id and password by clicking key board buttons from the screen instead of
                                    using keyboard itself. This will save your Internet Banking user-id and password from
                                    key-board trapping softwares. </li>
                                <li>Avoid accessing our Internet Banking Services from public places or from shared
                                    computers such as those in cyber cafes. You never know what malicious programs might be

                                <li>Exit using the 'Logout' button. Always exit using the 'Logout' button to ensure you end

                                <li>When you've finished using the Internet, always disconnect. Avoid leaving your
                                    connection on, especially with broadband access, unless you're actively using it. </li>
                                <li>Do not leave an Internet banking session unattended at any time. </li>

                                    other websites are open. This will protect your computer from the possible harm by being
                                    exposed to other websites while you are doing banking transactions and can help to
                                    ensure your financial information is protected and blocked from unauthorised access via

                                <li>It's good practice to create passwords to protect your computer and to know everyone who

                                <br><strong>How can I enable my browser to use 128-bit encryption? </strong>
    
                                <br>Depending upon the browser you are using you can check whether 128-bit SSL is being used
                                in the following ways:
    
                                <br>For Microsoft Internet Explorer Move your mouse over the 'security lock icon' at the
                                bottom-right corner. A tool-tip of "SSL secured (128-bit)" should pop up if you are
                                connected using 128 Bit SSL; OR
    
                                Depending upon the browser you are using you can check whether 128-bit SSL is being used in
                                the following ways:
    
                                For Microsoft Internet Explorer
                                <br>Move your mouse over the 'security lock icon' at the bottom-right corner. A tool-tip of
                                "SSL secured (128-bit)" should pop up if you are connected using 128 Bit SSL; OR
                                <br>From the 'File' menu in the toolbar, select 'Properties'. "Connection" with "SSL 3.0,
                                RC4 with 128-bit encryption (High); RSA with 1024 bit exchange" is shown if you are
                                connected using 128 Bit SSL.
                                For Netscape Navigator
                                <br>Click 'Security' in the toolbar. A 'Security Info' window will be displayed. Click 'Open
                                page info'. The message displayed should be: "This is a secure document that uses a
                                high-grade encryption key for US domestic use only (RC4, 128-bit)"
                                <br>If you find that 128-bit encryption is NOT being used in the Netscape Navigator browser,
                                you should configure the settings in the browser to ensure 128-bit encryption.
                                This can be done as follows:
                                <br>Click 'Security' in the toolbar
                                <br>Click 'Navigator' in the left column
                                <br>Click 'Configure SSL v3' on the right of 'Enable SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) v3'
    
                                <br>Enable all ciphers except 'No encryption with an MD5 MAC'.
                                <br>
                                <br><strong>Why do the Internet banking pages expire? </strong>
    
                                <br>Because the security of our site is important to you, page expiry occurs to prevent the
                                pages from being stored in your browser. This feature is meant to secure the confidentiality
                                of your financial information.
    
                                <br>Can I exit by closing the browser window?
    
                                <br>Do not exit by closing the browser window. If you simply close the browser window, you
                                cannot be sure that your Internet banking session is terminated properly. Always exit by
                                using the 'Logout' button to ensure you end each Internet banking session securely.
